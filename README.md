#Boozy Basics

* This app provides the user with a space to create drinks and view previously made  drinks by other users; sort of like an alcohol recipe book!

###Future Features:
* I want users to be able to search by base alcohol (vodka, whiskey etc.) and see a list of drink recipes that use that base.
* I also want users to be able to pin drinks that they like to their "liquore library" which will be a place that hold all of their liked drinks.
