#Boozy Basics

* This app provides the user with a space to create drinks and view previously made  drinks by other users; sort of like an alcohol recipe book!

###Current Features:
* Visitors can view drinks but cannot create drinks nor edit previously posted drinks.
*  Visitors are prompted to either sign in or sign up.
* Users can create drinks and view other previously created drinks.
* Users can also edit and delete their own drinks.

###Future Features:
* I want users to be able to search by base alcohol (vodka, whiskey etc.) and see a list of drink recipes that use that base.
* I also want users to be able to pin drinks that they like to their "liquore library" which will be a place that holds all of their liked drinks.
